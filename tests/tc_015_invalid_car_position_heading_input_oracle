Provide the room size in meters as two integers separated with a space in the format "WIDTH LENGTH" and then press enter.
Provide the start position and heading with format "X Y D" where X is the position on the rooms width axis and Y on the rooms length axis. D is the cardinal direction (the heading) given as 'N', 'E', 'S', or 'W' character.
The input should have the format "X Y D" where X is the position on the rooms width axis and Y on the rooms length axis. D is the cardinal direction (the heading) givern as 'N', 'E', 'S', or 'W' character.
